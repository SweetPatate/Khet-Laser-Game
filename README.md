# Khet-Laser-Game
Khet is a board game using a Laser, each player has a Laser intended to "disintegrate" his opponent's masterpiece; the Pharaoh. The principle of the game is simple but very effective. The players position their pieces on the board in such a way as to direct their laser beam. Most of the pieces have one or two reflective surfaces that allow the energy to be channelled and deflected towards the enemy forces...
The laser beam follows the path that you design with your pieces: Pyramids, Obelisks and 'Djed' columns. 
This requires strategy, intuition and a good spatial representation. 
At the end of his turn, the player activates the Laser, which ricochets from one room to another at 90Â° angles... The game does not stop there, indeed, your role is to stop the progression of the Laser of your opponent by positioning your pieces in his tactical scheme to protect you.
Each press on the Laser is preceded by a real moment of tension and excitement... Indeed, it is only at the moment of firing that you can check the value of your 'reflection'!
